## Description 

With the help of Node.js and its test abilities, I have created an application where the user is prompted questions in order to build their team. This application will ask about team members’ names, emails, and other important information. This is possible through defining constructors within a constructor, linking JavaScript and HMTL pages to those sub constructors, taking those formatted HTML pages to a main template, and rendering them out on to an output page. This code, with the addition of some CSS Bootstrap, creates a clean directory page with each team members’ information in a card.
